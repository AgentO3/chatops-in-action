# ChatOps In Action

Is the chatroom a part of your company culture? If so, then ChatOps should also be. Rather than talking about your tools in the chatroom, talk to your tools in the chatroom! 

In this fast paced talk, I will give a short introduction to ChatOps and some of the key benefits of integrating it into your workflow. After that, I will start with simple but very useful commands you can easily and safely implement in your company's chat. I will build upon those simple commands with examples of increasingly more powerful commands, from wrapping ChatOps scripts around everyday commands such as deployment to more powerful operations-specific tasks such as managing the state of services, pulling logs from multiple servers at once, and bringing those logs directly back into the chatroom conversation. I'll conclude with an example of using multiple ChatBots working together to automatically execute tasks based on what is happening in the chatroom. This can be as simple as pulling back logs and graphs when a notification of a failing service is mentioned in the chat, or as complex as automatically executing commands to fix that failing service without the need for human intervention.

Attendees will leave with easy to implement but ChatOps commands that will demonstrate the usefulness of ChatOps and provide inspiration for more powerful commands that can simplify sometimes confusing and/or dangerous operations tasks to complete automation.
